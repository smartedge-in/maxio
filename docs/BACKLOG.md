|----|-------|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| ~~P1-09~~ | ~~Virtual-hosted-style requests~~ | api | XL | Done — `Host: bucket.{server_host}` dispatch; `MAXIO_SERVER_HOST`; SigV4 uses client path; integration test with explicit Host. | — |

| ~~P1-13~~ | ~~EC corruption tests in CI~~ | ci | S | Done — `aws-cli` job starts MaxIO with `--erasure-coding`; corruption checks in `aws_cli_test.sh` run, not skip. | — |

---

## P2 — Maintainability & code health

| ID | Title | Area | Effort | Description | Acceptance criteria |
|----|-------|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| ~~P2-01~~ | ~~Split `filesystem.rs`~~ | storage | L | Done — `src/storage/filesystem/` with `mod.rs`, `common.rs`, `object_io`, `multipart`, `encryption_io`, `listing`, `housekeeping`; behavior unchanged. | — |
| ~~P2-02~~ | ~~Reduce crate-level clippy allows~~ | storage | M | Done — removed crate-level `#![allow(clippy::…)]` from `main.rs` / `lib.rs`; fixed mechanical lints; `too_many_arguments` allowed on 3 storage entry points with comments. | — |

## P2 — Operations tooling

| ID | Title | Area | Effort | Description | Acceptance criteria |
|----|-------|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| ~~P2-13~~ | ~~Authenticated admin API (remote ops)~~ | api | L | Done — `/api/admin/v1/*` with Bearer token or Basic access/secret auth, per-IP rate limiting, JSON handlers for status/info/doctor/buckets/keyring/housekeeping; integration tests. | — |

|----|-------|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| ~~P2-07~~ | ~~Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint~~ | ops | M | Done — `MAXIO_METRICS_ENABLED` exposes `GET /metrics`; optional `MAXIO_METRICS_PORT` dedicated listener; counters for requests, latency, SlowDown, upload bytes; gauges for uptime, disk, multipart uploads. | — |
| ~~P2-08~~ | ~~Structured audit log~~ | security | M | Done — `MAXIO_AUDIT_LOG` emits JSON lines (`target=maxio_audit`) for mutating S3/console/admin requests: principal, bucket, key, status, outcome. | — |

---

## P3 — Nice-to-have / future

| ID | Title | Area | Effort | Description | Acceptance criteria |
|----|-------|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| ~~P3-01~~ | ~~Lifecycle rules (expiration)~~ | storage | L | Done — prefix-based `LifecycleRule` on `BucketMeta`; `PUT/GET/DELETE ?lifecycle`; hourly housekeeping sweep expires non-versioned objects. | — |
| ~~P3-02~~ | ~~Replication / federation~~ | storage | XL | Done (RFC) — `docs/plans/2026-06-29-replication-federation.md`; implementation deferred to Phase 1+ runbook. | — |
| ~~P3-03~~ | ~~SQLite metadata index~~ | storage | L | Done — `MAXIO_METADATA_INDEX` enables `{data_dir}/.maxio-metadata.db`; upsert on write/delete; rebuild on startup; walk fallback. | — |
| ~~P3-04~~ | ~~Workspace crate split~~ | storage | L | Done — `crates/maxio-storage` (filesystem, crypto, keys, policy, quota) and `crates/maxio-server` (HTTP/S3 API, auth, embedded UI); root `maxio` is a facade binary + re-exports; `map_storage_upload_error` lives in server `error` module. | — |
| P3-05 | ARM64 release binaries | ci | S | Release workflow may be x86-only today. | Multi-arch Docker image and GitHub release assets. |
| P3-06 | UI E2E tests (Playwright) | ui | M | No browser-level tests for upload/download flows. | Smoke test: login → create bucket → upload → download → delete. |
| ~~P3-07~~ | ~~Per-bucket erasure coding toggle~~ | storage | L | Done — `BucketMeta.erasure_coding` override; `PUT/GET ?erasure`; writes use `effective_erasure_coding()`; reads layout-based; existing flat objects unchanged. | — |
| P3-08 | Keycloak console UI login | ui | M | Server exposes `/api/auth/keycloak-config`, `keycloak-login`, and `keycloak-refresh` on `feat/keycloak-auth`; Svelte console still uses access/secret login only. | `Login.svelte` reads `keycloak-config` on load; when enabled, username/password form calls `keycloak-login` and reuses cookie session; silent refresh before expiry; access/secret form hidden when Keycloak-only; Playwright smoke test for Keycloak path (extends P3-06). |
| P3-09 | Replication Phase 1 — operator sync runbook | ops | M | Phase 0 RFC done (P3-02). Phase 1 adds no replication daemon: operators use `rclone`/`rsync` for active-passive DR. See `docs/plans/2026-06-29-replication-federation.md` § Phase 1. | `docs/operations.md` runbook (sync, keyring/credential coordination, multipart quiesce, failover checklist); paginated bucket inventory export via admin API or `maxio-admin`; integration test for inventory endpoint. |
| P3-10 | Replication Phase 2 — mutation event log | storage | XL | Introduce `StorageBackend` trait and append-only replication log on every mutating storage op; builds on metadata index patterns (P3-03). See RFC § Phase 2. | `MAXIO_REPLICATION_LOG` enables durable log; event schema covers ObjectPut/Delete and bucket meta changes; idempotent replay helper + unit tests; Prometheus lag/sequence metrics. |
| P3-11 | Replication Phase 3 — replication agent | storage | XL | Sidecar `maxio-replicate` tails Phase 2 log and applies changes to standby `data_dir` (active-passive). See RFC § Phase 3. | Agent with checkpoint, bucket include/exclude, lag metrics/alerts; primary PUT → agent → standby GET integration test; failover/failback steps added to operations guide. |
| P3-12 | Multiple replicas support | storage | XL | **Epic** — MaxIO is single-node today; scaling Kubernetes `replicas>1` without coordinated storage is not supported. This item tracks active-passive multi-node deployments (primary + standby/read replica), not erasure-coding parity shards or active/active multi-master. Implementation path: P3-09 → P3-10 → P3-11 (`docs/plans/2026-06-29-replication-federation.md`). | ≥1 standby replica stays within configurable lag of primary; failover runbook validated in docs; `maxio-replicate` agent shipped; integration test: write primary → read standby; explicit non-goals documented (no S3 CRR XML, no multi-master writes). Closes when P3-09, P3-10, and P3-11 are done. |
| P3-13 | Asymmetric scale-out with dual Raft (epic) | storage | XL | **Epic** — P3-04 split is compile-time only. Scale architecture **must** use **two independent Raft consensus groups** (storage tier + server tier), each with its own quorum and leader election. See `docs/plans/2026-06-29-distributed-scale-raft.md`. Depends on P3-10 (`StorageBackend`); distinct from interim DR track P3-09–P3-11. | Storage Raft (P3-14) and Server Raft (P3-15) shipped; asymmetric replica counts per tier; leader failover tests per tier; colocated single-node mode remains default (Raft off). Closes when P3-14 and P3-15 are done. |
| P3-14 | Storage tier Raft consensus | storage | XL | Raft cluster inside `maxio-storage`: replicates bucket/object metadata, multipart state, bucket settings, keyring epoch. Object bytes stay on local FS per node; metadata mutations go through Raft leader. Phase A in distributed-scale-raft plan. | 3-node storage quorum bootstrap/join; metadata write via leader; follower failover < configured SLA in integration test; `StorageBackend` routes mutations through Raft; metrics: `raft_storage_leader`, `raft_storage_commit_lag`. |
| P3-15 | Server tier Raft consensus | api | XL | **Independent** Raft cluster inside `maxio-server`: replicates server membership, storage endpoint map, credential fingerprint epoch, admin routing generation. Any server member serves S3 data plane against storage tier; control writes go through server Raft leader. Phase B in distributed-scale-raft plan. | 2+ server quorum; routing snapshot replicated; storage leader change propagated without manual config; `/readyz` reflects storage quorum reachability; integration test with P3-14 cluster; metrics: `raft_server_leader`, `raft_server_commit_lag`. |
